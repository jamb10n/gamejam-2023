Have made multiple footstep surfaces, some with different choices depending on frequency area, higher-frequency/mid-frequency, feel free to choose which you want to use. Main surfaces will depend on the level I guess, it would be good to use the wood footsteps on the bridge perhaps.Have made variations of the following if you’re willing to create the code to run this, they are as follows –* Character light attack* Footsteps* Enemy death* Character voiceIf not choose the one you think is best and how to run it. Character voice just perhaps appearing on start if needed one time.The enemy voice is intended to be a loop to hear as the enemy draws closer that stops when combat starts, if this is too much to implement no problem!
